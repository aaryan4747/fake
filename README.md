Fake-News-Detection-Project
Final Year College Project with Project Synopsis, Report, PPT, Code and Documents
Abstract
The advent of the World Wide Web and the rapid adoption of social media platforms (such as Facebook and Twitter) paved the way for information dissemination that has never been witnessed in the human history before. With the current usage of social media platforms, consumers are creating and sharing more information than ever before, some of which are misleading with no relevance to reality. Automated classification of a text article as misinformation or disinformation is a challenging task. Even an expert in a particular domain has to explore multiple aspects before giving a verdict on the truthfulness of an article. In this work, we propose to use machine learning ensemble approach for automated classification of news articles. Our study explores different textual properties that can be used to distinguish fake contents from real. By using those properties, we train a combination of different machine learning algorithms using various ensemble methods and evaluate their performance on 4 real world datasets. Experimental evaluation confirms the superior performance of our proposed ensemble learner approach

Project is in Python Programming.

The Fake News Detection System is a machine learning-based project developed to identify whether a news article is real or fake by analyzing its textual content. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and clean the data, followed by feature extraction using methods such as TF-IDF vectorization. A supervised learning algorithm like Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes is then trained on the processed dataset to classify news articles accurately. The model evaluates patterns in the text and predicts authenticity with high accuracy. This project demonstrates practical implementation of text mining, data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation. It can be further enhanced with deep learning models, web integration, or cloud deployment, making it a strong real-world application of AI and machine learning in combating misinformation.
